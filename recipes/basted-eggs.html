        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe produces a delicious, simple egg with satisfying, set whites and a creamy, 
            runny yolk. It's similar to a poached egg, but more flavorful and less fussy.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites have almost set, 
                about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat to medium-low and cook 
                until whites have set, yolks are still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 
                2 more minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate, garnish with pepper and flaky salt, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
